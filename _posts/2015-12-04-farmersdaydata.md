The Farmers’ Day celebrations was instituted in 1985 to recognize and reward hard working farmers for their illustrious contribution to the growth of the Ghanaian economy. Ever since then, the day has been celebrated on every first Friday of the month of December. Awards are given out to the well-deserving farmers in an event which is held in a part of the country each year. This year’s celebration will take place at Bolgatanga in the Upper East Region. 

The 2015 Farmers’ Day celebration is dubbed “Transform Ghana: Invest in Agriculture”. The theme alone is indicative of government’s commitment to bringing a massive transformation to the Agric. sector of the economy. And it is very much in line with Ghana’s National Development Plan which has “The Transformation of the Ghanaian Economy through Accelerated Agriculture Modernisation and Sustainable Resource Management” as one of its central themes. The map below contains information on the venues of the Farmers’ Day celebration since its inception till 2014. Interacting with the nodes will reveal the best farmer on the day; the theme of the event and the region the farmer is based in.

We would like to take this opportunity to congratulate all Ghanaian farmers for their hardwork and dedication.
