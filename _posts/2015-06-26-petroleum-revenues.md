The Public Interest and Accountability Committee is a statutory committee established under Section 51 of the Petroleum Revenue Management Act 2011 (Act 815). As part of its responsibilities, the committee provides an independent assessment of the management of Petroleum Funds by releasing periodic reports on the matter.

The committee admits to have challenges with sticking to deadlines for the release of the reports because of some resource constraints. Nevertheless, it is poised to present comprehensible reports on the management of Petroleum Revenue as and when they are ready.

Up there in the image is a graphic representation of the distribution and management of Petroleum Revenues in 2013. Tracing from the Total Petroleum Revenue, we can see that the Government of Ghana (GoG) had 73.77% of the total amount and Ghana National Petroleum Corporation (GNPC) had 26.23%. The government distributed the Petroleum Revenue it received into various funds. One of which is the Annual Budget Fund Amount (ABFA). The ABFA was supposed to be spent on four priority areas. These areas are: 
Roads and other infrastructure;
Amortization of loans for the energy sector;
Agricultural modernization;
Capacity building.
According to the PIAC’s 2013 report, the Capacity Building priority area was neglected totally in 2013 by the government as funds were diverted into other areas like the Venture Capital Fund, Exim Guarantee Fund and Petroleum Commission.

That leaves no amount available for the money’s intended purpose: Capacity Building in the Oil and Gas sector of the Ghanaian economy. The Capacity Building priority area must receive its share of the ABFA in subsequent years. This will go a long way to revamp the oil and gas industry in this country which will yield expected results for all.
