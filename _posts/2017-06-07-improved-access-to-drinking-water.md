Today is #WorldOceansday, a day set aside globally to celebrate the ocean. Countless events are held at different parts of the world to draw attention to the pollution of the ocean and other harmful activities by humans that reduce the pure state of the ocean.
 
The Code for Ghana team decided to do an infographic on the access to safe-drinking water in Ghana in the years 1990, 2000 and 2015. The infographic highlights how access to safe-drinking water has improved in the urban areas, rural areas and nationally. The data was compiled by the joint effort of WHO and UNICEF called the [Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation](https://www.wssinfo.org/data-estimates/tables/). 
 
> The JMP strategy was formulated by WHO and UNICEF, with support from a newly created Strategic Advisory Group to better position the JMP to address the monitoring challenges in the run up to the MDG target year of 2015 and beyond.
 
We would like to take this opportunity to wish everybody working around the clock to keep ocean water unpolluted a happy World Oceans Day. Also, may we be awaken to the disparity in the access to safe-drinking water between the rural and urban centers. May we not relent in our work until access to safe-drinking water is uniform across the lengths and breadths of Ghana.
