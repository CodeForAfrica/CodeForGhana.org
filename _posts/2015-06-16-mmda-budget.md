Ghana’s 2015 budget was presented to parliament by the Finance Minister, Hon. Seth Terkpeh on 19th November, 2014. The title of the budget was ‘Securing the bright medium term prospects of the Economy’. The title suggests the government’s desire to bring economic growth into the country. 

The budget is simply a projection of what government intends to do in a particular year and at what cost. Administratively, Ghana is divided into 10 regions. These regions have several district and municipal assemblies under them, all of which come together to form the local government.
