The purpose of the CarteInnov project is to promote initiatives for technological creation and innovation within the Francophone economic space and to help increase the number of exchanges and partnerships between Francophone digital communities.

Presented publicly on the occasion of the next Francophonie Summit (Antananarivo, November 26-27, 2016), the map will be broadcast on the online platform of the Francophone Innovation Network [www.francophonieinnovation.org](https://www.francophonieinnovation.org/). OIF in partnership with the Wallonia-Brussels Federation. The data collected on the map will be hosted under the ODbL license within the OpenStreetMap collaborative digital device, in order to promote their free access, download and reuse. A simplified online form will soon add and update this data on the map.
