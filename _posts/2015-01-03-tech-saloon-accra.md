Citizens of every country have a right to know what goes on in their country. Especially issues concerning governance and the use of public funds (since these two cases -and many more- go a long way to affect their lives). Information is not readily accessible. Sometimes it appears to be, but the bureaucracy surrounding its acquisition seems intentionally set-up to reduce interest in acquiring information. This remains paramount amongst the causes of corruption in our country and Africa as a whole.





Without the right information, how do citizens judge the work of a government? How can citizens know about what was done with the taxes collected from them? This leads to the kind of discourses we are exposed to these days on our airwaves. Mostly, well-meaning Ghanaians level incorrect allegations against the government. Sometimes there is a total ignorance of areas the government is performing poorly in because we just do not know about them. The need for information dissemination cannot be overemphasized. It is almost as important as the development of a nation. As a matter of fact, it is a prominent indicator of the development of a country. It leads to healthy discourses amongst citizens and between citizens and the government. When a clear picture about the real state of the country’s economy is readily available and accessible,investors will know which areas to concentrate their investments. The benefits are enormous, hence the attempts to implement the Open Data Initiative in this country. An initiative which will make information available to be used or republished by citizens. Many people are calling for this to be implemented on a large scale in this country, seeing how advantageous it is.





Pen Plus Bytes recently held the the first ever Technology Salon in the country at the New Media Hub Osu. It was a very engaging discussion as the many IT professionals, Communications Specialists and Social Media Strategists that were gathered there made passionate contributions to the subject under discussion. The event was dubbed ‘what technology can help Ghanaians keep the government accountable?’. The discussion was largely on the Open Data Initiative. Some of the points made by attendees are of grave importance to the entire nation and should not be taken for granted at all. The issue of Ghanaians’ seemingly lack of interest in what goes on in the country was raised. One of the attendees made the point that if more Ghanaians would pay their taxes it would increase the level of interest in government’s expenditure by Ghanaians. This is why: people are selfish in caring about their money – and rightly so – they  would want to see their money yield tangible benefits for them. Hence if a large number of Ghanaians paid their taxes it would automatically translate to an increase in concern in how government handles the tax-payers’ money – which is our money. Thereby ensuring that the government is kept on its toes. Nevertheless, this sends us back to the point made earlier in this post – the need for information accessibility. If people do not know the importance of taxes, they will never be willing to pay. If people do not see their taxes being used appropriately, they will never be willing to pay either. Therefore, tax-evasion will linger on as an economic problem if measures are not put in place to adequately communicate how taxes are being used.

 
 
 
The Code for Ghana Initiative involves embedding Data Fellows and Software Developers in media organisations to come up with innovative ways to disseminate information to the public. This is a brilliant initiative. One of the points raised at this Technology Salon was about the fact that media men need to analyse the information they get before putting it out there. In the sense that, not everybody is literate enough to understand some economic terms and their implications. For some farmers in the rural areas, they would not care about what goes on in microeconomics; all they care about is how to put food on the tables for their families. It will take the demystifying of economic information to them to get them to understand the real state of the country and how it will affect them. This may require the use of new technologies or simply taking advantage of already existing ones. If necessary, we can use multimedia presentations to get them to understand what goes on in the country. Videos communicate more directly to the mind. So videos will be useful in the dissemination of information to non-literate Ghanaians.





As already stated, the event was dubbed ‘What Technology can help Ghanaians keep the government accountable’. The use of technology in communication grows each day as new inventions are made. With a smartphone citizens can take pictures and videos of certain scenes and events that are of national interest. They can go on to post them directly on youtube or spread them on platforms such as facebook and whatsapp. It is that simple. But it is characteristic of us to say we are ill-equipped to keep the government on its toes (even though we have the power of the internet in our hands). Therefore, at the Technology Salon, we came to the conclusion that it is not a matter of waiting for the arrival of new technologies but it is all about using existing ones more effectively.
