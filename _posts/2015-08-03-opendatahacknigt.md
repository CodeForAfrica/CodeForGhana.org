Code for Ghana organized a two day hackathon dubbed Open Data Hack Night. It was held at [Mobile Web Ghana](http://www.mobilewebghana.org) from 31st July to 1st August. The overnight-hackathon was organized to introduce developers to civic app development and give them the opportunity to come up with some apps and data visualization to benefit the Ghanaian society.

The Code for Ghana team outlined some areas in the Ghanaian economy and history of some disasters that the developers could work on. Hence, [data sets](http://www.data.gov.gh) were provided on these areas and events which included: government spending and revenue, energy consumption, road accidents, fire outbreaks, floods etc. Participants were allowed to work with their own data sets too.

The two-day event began with the arrival of participants on Friday 31st July at 10:00am. The registration process was brief; participants settled down immediately afterwards for the event to commence. It began with a brief introduction by Adams Agalic. He gave a progress report on the Code for Ghana project: the training program at the various media houses and the data projects we have done on our website. Right after that the participants were taken through a training session in [R](https://www.r-project.org/) by Code for Ghana data fellow Nana Baah Gyan. R is a programming language used for statistics and data modeling. All the participants were made to install R on their laptops so that they could try their hands at it while they were being taught. Then Nana took them through the basics of the language and immediately taught them how to make some visualization. The first visualization the participants were assigned to do with R was a graph depicting the number of searches done on ‘dumsor’ on Wikipedia. It was easy to grasp as most of the participants produced the curve right away. Nana Baah lent a helping hand to those who couldn’t do it immediately. He also taught the participants word mining and how to make word clouds. It is a way of visualizing the most frequently used words in a text. In the visualization, the words that appear in the biggest fonts are the ones that appeared frequently in the text and the smallest represents the least used words. 


Soon after that, the participants were asked to break into groups, come up with ideas to work and start coding. This is where the essence of the hack night was really seen. As some of the participants left when it was late, 15 of them slept over to code throughout the night. In our bid to give them ample time to work on their projects in order to produce something meaningful and usable the next day, we made the option of sleeping over available. The teams that had some of their members going home were pleased to by the presence of those members early Saturday morning.

Early Saturday morning, we were joined by Code for Ghana data fellow Afua Ankomah. She came to supervise the work of the teams and offer help where needed. Gradually the individual projects were shaping up and one could easily see what each team intended to build. Another remarkable thing about the hackathon was the fact that the participants were fairly young – most of them were students – but the level of enthusiasm was very high. The participants were allowed to code for almost the whole day. At 5pm, they were asked to stop and make their presentations.

In all we had seven projects: [Team X](http://mwga.meteor.com/), [Team Awesome](http://davidlartey.com/data-awesome), Team AIT, [Team Sprouty](http://www.teamsprouty.sproutypromo.com/pages/agricultural-gdp-trends), [Team Dab Lab](http://github.com/laudb/dablab), [Team Fire Viz](http://www.fireviz.pe.hu) and [Dear MP]().

Team X was the first to make their presentation. They built a platform that displays commodity prices in Ghana on the world market.
