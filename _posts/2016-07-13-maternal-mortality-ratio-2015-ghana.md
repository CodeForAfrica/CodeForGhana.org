“**Maternal Mortality** is the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management but not from accidental or incidental causes.”

The figures represented above - posted on the [WHO website](http://apps.who.int/gho/data/view.main.1390?lang=en) - are very alarming  especially because the causes of most of the deaths are avoidable. There must be an improvement in Maternal Health Care in this country to help reduce the number of maternal deaths recorded each year. Some of the causes of Maternal Deaths include: hemorrhage, unsafe abortions, infectious diseases, hypertensive diseases etc.
