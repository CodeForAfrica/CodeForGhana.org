						<p>
						Open Data has a huge potential to drive change. As part of the open-data movement Code for Ghana brings together civic-minded developers, the media, government agencies, civil-society groups and the private sector to create avenues for citizen engagement and responsive governance through technology.
						</p>
						<p>
						We achieve this through the following activities:
						<ul>
							<li>Embed developers and data fellows in newsrooms to create innovative technology platforms for better information dissemination and encourage collective action through citizen engagement.
							</li>
							<li>Organise data bootcamps to share open-data tools and techniques and demonstrate the value of open-data with the public.</li>
							<li>Build civic apps and platforms that will keep citizens well informed so that they can demand accountability, transparency and better services from the government.</li>
							<li>Work with CSOs, NGOs and Government organisations to bring meaning to their data-sets</li>
						</ul>
