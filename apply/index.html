						<h2>About Code for Ghana</h2>
						<hr/>
                        <p>Do you want to empower citizens to better engage with their governments/communities? Code for Ghana is hiring the first set of fellows for its 2015 fellowship program, dedicated to help robust and independent media serve as a watchdog, holding government accountable and providing important information and analysis for citizens to more effectively engage in society and with government.</p>
                        <p>Code for Ghana will form a community of open-data experts and embed them into media organisations to bring open-data applications into Ghanaian newsrooms. This community of civic technologists will develop and use apps to analyse and interpret open data from sources such as the recently launched <a href="http://www.data.gov.gh"><b>Ghana Open Data Initiative (GODI)</b></a>. The fellowship will enable a few hackers or “data fellows” with professional backgrounds in <b>UI/UX Design</b>, <b>Data Analysis</b>, <b>Software Engineering</b> and <b>Research</b> to work intensively within media organisations for six months. These data fellows will serve as catalysts and enablers who help create the internal systems and resources necessary to entrench data as a critical component of the Ghanaian newsroom culture.</p>
                        <hr/>
